Object-Oriented Email Sending SDK

  It is as simple as this:

+--
import com.jcabi.immutable.Array;
import com.jcabi.email.Enclosure;
import com.jcabi.email.Envelope;
import com.jcabi.email.Postmap;
import com.jcabi.email.wire.SMTP;
import com.jcabi.email.Stamp;
import com.jcabi.email.enclosure.EnBinary;
import com.jcabi.email.enclosure.EnPlain;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StBCC;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StRecipient;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StSender;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StSubject;

Postman postman = new Postman.Default(
  new SMTP("smtp.googlemail.com", 465, "username", "password")
);
postman.send(
  new Envelope.MIME(
    new Array<Stamp>(
      new StSender("Yegor Bugayenko <yegor@jcabi.com>"),
      new StRecipient("Jeff Lebowski <jeff@gmail.com>"),
      new StSubject("dude, how are you?"),
      new StBCC("my-boss@jcabi.com")
    ),
    new Array<Enclosure>(
      new EnPlain("Hi, long time no see! :) Check my pic!"),
      new EnBinary(
        new File("/tmp/picture.gif"),
        "my-picture.gif",
        "image/gif"
      )
    )
  )
);
+--

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-email/${project.version}/jcabi-email-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-email-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-email</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--

  Well, you will also need these (in this specific order):

<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
  <artifactId>activation</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.1</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.mail</groupId>
  <artifactId>mail</artifactId>
  <version>1.5.0-b01</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.mail</groupId>
  <artifactId>mailapi</artifactId>

  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
