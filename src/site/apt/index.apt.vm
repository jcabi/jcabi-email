Object-Oriented Email Sending SDK

  It is as simple as this:

+--
import com.jcabi.immutable.Array;
import com.jcabi.email.Enclosure;
import com.jcabi.email.Envelope;
import com.jcabi.email.Postmap;
import com.jcabi.email.wire.SMTP;
import com.jcabi.email.Stamp;
import com.jcabi.email.enclosure.EnBinary;
import com.jcabi.email.enclosure.EnPlain;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StBCC;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StRecipient;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StSender;
import com.jcabi.email.stamp.StSubject;

Postman postman = new Postman.Default(
  new SMTP(
    new Token("user", "password").access(
      new Protocol.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587)
    )
  )
);
postman.send(
  new Envelope.MIME(
    new Array<Stamp>(
      new StSender("Yegor Bugayenko <yegor@jcabi.com>"),
      new StRecipient("Jeff Lebowski <jeff@gmail.com>"),
      new StSubject("dude, how are you?"),
      new StBCC("my-boss@jcabi.com")
    ),
    new Array<Enclosure>(
      new EnPlain("Hi, long time no see! :) Check my pic!"),
      new EnBinary(
        new File("/tmp/picture.gif"),
        "my-picture.gif",
        "image/gif"
      )
    )
  )
);
+--

  <artifactId>jcabi-email</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
